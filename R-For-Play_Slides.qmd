## Why This Talk

::: {style="font-size: 60%;"}

- We often think of R as something we use for work or research.

- But what if R could also be fun, creative, and personal?

- Today, I’ll share a few of my pet projects that made my everyday life more playful.

> "Play is the highest form of research." – Albert Einstein

```{r art}
#| fig-width: 4
#| fig-height: 5
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(42)
n <- 500
df <- data.frame(
  x = sin(seq(0, 4*pi, length.out = n)) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1),
  y = cos(seq(0, 4*pi, length.out = n)) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.1),
  color = seq_len(n)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = color)) +
  geom_path(size = 1.2, alpha = 0.8) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = c("skyblue", "violet", "tomato")) +
  theme_void() +
  ggtitle("Spirals of R ✨") +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold", size = 16)
  )

## What ‘Play’ Means Here

- "Play" = experimenting, trying things without deadlines.

- Exploring what R can do outside of work or school.

- Learning through curiosity and creativity.


## Pet Project 1 – Tidytuesday Adventures

- I use #TidyTuesday to explore new datasets * .

- It's a great way to practice data wrangling, visualisation, and storytelling.

Example project: 


## Pet Project 2 – Personal Menu Generator 🍜

- When I moved to a new city, I built a script to help me choose what to eat.

- It randomly picked meals from a list, saving time and making it fun!

- You can wrap it in a simple Shiny app or use it from the console!

## Pet Project 3 – Gift Selector 🎁

- I made a small data frame of gift ideas and built a random picker.

- Great for birthdays, holidays, or when I wanted to treat myself!


## Pet Project 4 – Designing Pride Flags with R 🏳🌈

- I used R to design pride flag patterns for my home.

- Packages: {ggplot2}, {grid}, {ggpattern}.

Here’s a simple example:

## Pet Project 5 – R on My Phone 📱

- Installed R on my phone via Termux / Posit Cloud.

- Handy for testing small code snippets anywhere!

- Example use cases:

  - Quick data summaries

  - Random number generators

  - Small visual experiments

(Show a screenshot if you have one.)

## Pet Project 6: Shiny App to Explore LGBTQ+ Movies in the UK 🎬🏳🌈

- Aim: celebrate queer cinema and discover films people might have missed!

- Built a Shiny app that lets users explore data on LGBTQ+ movies shown in UK cinemas or available on streaming.

- Users can filter by:

  - Year, genre, director, and representation type

  - IMDb rating or audience score

Visuals:

- Interactive scatterplots (ggplotly or {plotly})

- Word clouds of film themes or directors

- Data sourced from public film datasets and APIs (e.g., IMDb or TMDb).

## Curating and Sharing: My WeAreR-Ladies Week 💜

- I had the chance to curate **@WeAreRLadies**, the rotating Twitter/X account that features R users worldwide.  

- To prepare, I built an **R Markdown file** full of ideas and topics I wanted to share.  
- Throughout the week I:
  - Explored new `#TidyTuesday` datasets 🎨  
  - Shared interesting packages — like **{tidylog}**, my wrangling co-pilot 🧭  
  - Posted reflections on learning, creativity, and community  

- This experience reminded me that *sharing what you learn is also a form of play* —  
  it keeps curiosity alive and builds connection across the R world.

```{r tidylog_demo, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidylog)  # My co-pilot!

mtcars %>%
  filter(mpg > 25) %>%
  select(mpg, hp)
```

- Add a screenshot of one of your WeAreR-Ladies posts or tweets.  
- Include the R-Ladies hex sticker or logo in a corner for a pop of colour.  

## Why Play Matters

- Playful R projects helped me:

  - Learn new packages and tricks.

  - Stay motivated and curious.

  - See R as part of everyday life, not just work.

- Fun projects build real skills.

## What You Can Try Next

- Join `#TidyTuesday` and pick a dataset that interests you.

- Try making generative art with {ggplot2}.

- Analyse your Spotify, Strava, or sleep data.

- Build something personal: a random quote generator or meal picker.

"If it brings you joy, it’s worth coding."


## Closing Thoughts

- R is not just for work — it’s for life, art, and play.

- Be curious. Experiment. Share.

- Thank you!
