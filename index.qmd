## Why This Talk

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 60%;"}
- We often think of R as something we use for work or research.
- But what if R could also be fun, creative, and personal?
- Today, I‚Äôll share a few of my pet projects that made my everyday life more playful.

## What 'Play' Means Here

- "Play" = experimenting, trying things without deadlines.

- Exploring what R can do outside of work or school.

- Learning through curiosity and creativity.


## Pet Project 1 ‚Äì Tidytuesday Adventures

**Aim:** To improve my data visualisation skills and understand which plots fit the data.

- I use [**#TidyTuesday**](https://github.com/LucyNjokiNjuki/Tidy_Tuesday) to explore new datasets üìä  

- It's a great way to practice data wrangling, visualisation, and storytelling.

**What I Gained:** Confidence in communicating insights visually, and new connections in the `#TidyTuesday` community.

### üí° Inspiration from [Nicola Rennie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-rennie/)

Nicola Rennie has a really practical way of approaching personal and learning projects in R:

- Keep a small list of packages you'd like to try out üíª
- Keep another list of plots or visual styles you'd like to learn üé®
- Get inspiration from what others create, even if it's not made in R!
  - The [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) is a great source of ideas.
  - [Visual Vocabulary - Designing with data](https://ft-interactive.github.io/visual-vocabulary/): There are many ways to visualise data, this guide helps you choose a chart type based on the key relationships in your story, offering a starting point for creating clear and meaningful visuals.

- When you find a new dataset, check if it connects to something on your list, that's your next mini-project! üöÄ


## Pet Project 2 ‚Äì Personal Menu Generator üçú

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size: 60%;"}

**Aim:** To make decision-making around meals easier and fun while settling into a new city/culture.

- When I moved to the UK, I built a script to help me choose what to eat during the departmental dinner.
- It randomly picked meals from a list, saving time and making it fun!

**What I Gained:** Practical use of randomness and reproducibility in everyday life.

:::


::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 50%;"}

The description of the dataset of menu choices included:

**starter**: 1) Pumpkin veloute, quince. hazelnut oil; 2) Chicken liver parfait, apple, brioche; 3) Devon brown crab crumpet, piccalilli, pink grapefruit, mint

**main dishes**: 1) Roast turkey with all the trimmings; 2) Pollock, caulilower gratin, chicory, seaweed butter, Port, blackberry ; 3) Brased ox cheek, Boulongerer potato, carrot, bone marrow, red wine

**dessert**: 1) Chocolate Fondant, salted caramel ice cream, boozy cherry; 2) Vanilla creme brulee, quince; 3) Stickey pear cake, toffee

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)

# create a tibble with all the options
dinner_df <- tibble(starter = c(1, 2, 3),
                    main = c(2, 1, 3),
                    dessert = c(3, 2, 1))
set.seed(01) # to reproduce the same values for the sample
(my_dinner <- dinner_df %>% 
  dplyr::sample_n(1))
```

:::

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

- Designed pride flags for my home using `R` and `ggplot2`.

- Experimented with colours, proportions, and geometric shapes.

- Learned how art and code can beautifully overlap.

**What I Gained**: I discovered that most of the ideas I imagine, R can actually create, which expanded my curiosity and confidence in exploring R programming. It also deepened my appreciation for how R blends data, design, and self-expression, and gave me a joyful way to decorate my home.

## Pet Project 5 ‚Äì R on My Phone üì±

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 70%;"}

**Aim:** To make R accessible for on-the-go experiments.

- Installed R on my phone via **Ubuntu** + **Termux**.
- Handy for testing small code snippets anywhere!

- Example use cases:
  - Quick data summaries
  - Random number generators
  - Running simple models while watching web lectures for my MSc
  
**What I Gained:** I learned how to install and run R on my phone, which means I can quickly test commands and ideas even without having R installed locally. It gave me a real sense of freedom ‚Äî knowing I can explore and experiment anywhere, anytime.

### Step-by-step: Run R inside Ubuntu + Termux

Do the steps below, having installed [**Termux** from Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux&utm_source=emea_Med)

1. Update termux packages: `pkg update && pkg upgrade -y`

2. Install the `proot-distro` tool: `pkg install proot-distro -y`

3. Install an Ubuntu `rootfs` (download + expand): `proot-distro install ubuntu`

4. List installed distros (optional check): `proot-distro list`

5. Enter the Ubuntu environment: `proot-distro login ubuntu`. Your prompt changes from something like: `u0_a123@localhost:~$` to `root@localhost:~#`

6. Now you are "inside" Ubuntu: use apt to install things: `apt update && apt upgrade -y`

7. Install R inside the Ubuntu container: `apt install r-base -y` 

8. Test if R is installed: `R --version`

9. Start R: `R`

10. Quit R: `q()`

## Pet Project 6: Shiny App to Explore LGBTQ+ Movies in the UK üé¨üåà

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 60%;"}

**Aim:** To celebrate queer cinema and explore data storytelling through interactivity. This project was a collaboration with my [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org/) buddy [Tami Martins](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tamimart), and together we experimented with adding features like a **chatbot** to share more information about each movie and used the `{golem}` package to better organise and structure our Shiny app.

- Built a Shiny app that lets users explore data on LGBTQ+ movies shown in UK cinemas or available on streaming.
- Users can filter by:
  - Year, genre, director, and representation type
  - IMDb rating or audience score

:::

::: {.column width="40%" style="font-size: 50%;"}

Visuals:

- Interactive scatterplots (ggplotly or {plotly})
- Word clouds of film themes or directors
- Data sourced from [tidyrainbow](https://github.com/r-lgbtq/tidyrainbow/tree/main/data/LGBTQ-movie-database) within rainbowR community

**What I Gained:** I learned how to quickly integrate a chatbot into Shiny, gained some confidence using `{golem}` for scalable app design, and appreciated how collaboration can make creative coding even more fun and rewarding.

## Curating and Sharing: My WeAreR-Ladies Week üíú

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" style="font-size: 50%;"}

**Aim:** To engage with the global R community by curating the @WeAreRLadies account, sharing resources, ideas, and projects that encourage creativity and confidence in using R. I wanted to highlight how diverse the R world can be, and spark new connections through conversation.

- I had the chance to curate **[WeAreRLadies](https://bsky.app/profile/weare.rladies.org)**, the rotating Bluesky account that features R users worldwide. 
- To prepare, I built an **R Markdown file** full of ideas and topics I wanted to share.  
- Throughout the week I:
  - Explored new `#TidyTuesday` datasets üé®  
  - Shared interesting packages like **{tidylog}**, my wrangling co-pilot üß≠  
  - Posted reflections on learning, creativity, and community  

- **What I Gained:** This experience reminded me that **sharing what you learn is also a form of play**; it keeps curiosity alive and builds genuine connections across the R world. I also gained new perspectives from others' journeys, discovered inspiring projects, and felt more connected to the creative, supportive spirit of the R community.

## Why Play Matters

- Playful R projects helped me:

  - Learn new packages and tricks.

  - Stay motivated and curious.

  - See R as part of everyday life, not just work.

- Fun projects build real skills.

## What You Can Try Next

- Join `#TidyTuesday` and pick a dataset that interests you.

- Try making generative art with `{ggplot2}`.

- Analyse your Spotify, Strava, or sleep data.

- Build something personal such as a random quote generator or meal picker.

>"If it brings you joy, it‚Äôs worth coding."


## Closing Thoughts

- R is not just for work or studies; it's for life, art, and play.
- Debugging: where curiosity turns frustration into discovery. ü™≤
- Be curious. Experiment. Share.

Thank you!
