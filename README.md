# 🎨 R for Play: When Data Meets Creativity

## Talk for Manchester R User Group (RUG)

### 📅 2025-11-13

#### Exploring how R can make everyday life more fun and personal

In this talk, I’ll be sharing some of my pet projects, including:

-	✨ Exploring #TidyTuesday datasets just for the joy of learning
-	🎁 Building a small gift recommender
-	🌈 Designing Pride flags with R
-	🎬 Collaborating on a Shiny app to explore LGBTQ+ movies
-	📱 Even running R on my phone to test quick ideas!

You’ll get a peek behind the scenes: the experiments, the happy accidents, and the moments where curiosity turned into discovery.
